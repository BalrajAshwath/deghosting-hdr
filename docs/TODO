HDRI deghosting algorithm:
    ✔ understand the dataset @done(19-04-21 15:47)
    ✔ complete the basic i/o @done(19-04-21 15:47)
    ☐ complete two algorithms as proposal
        ☐ sen2012 bug
            ✔ one or more arguments not assigned when calling votemex @done(19-04-21 22:00)
            solved. conflict between different versions of mex files
            run in MATLAB on Windows
        ☐ hu2013 bug
            ☐ slow computation (difference between matlab on Linux or Windows)
            mex files must be compiled on Linux due to absence of build_windows
            run in MATLAB on Linux
